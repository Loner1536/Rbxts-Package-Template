**THIS WAS MADE SO I COULD EASILY SETUP PACKAGES**

**TESTING**

* Change the alias for your package inside of test/tsconfig.ts 

**INFO**

* I hide some folders using .vscode/settings.json - **CHANGE IF NEEDED**
* Create NPM Token and add it inside of .npmrc.template and rename to .npmrc

**REQUIRED**

* CTRL+SHIFT+F YOUR_ everything outside the README.md needs to be changed to your liking

**THATS ALL | ENJOY**
